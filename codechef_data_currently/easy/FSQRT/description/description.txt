In olden days finding square roots seemed to be difficult but nowadays it can be easily done using in-built functions available across many languages 
.

Assume that you happen to hear the above words and you want to give a try in finding the square root of any given integer using in-built functions. So here's your chance.

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer T, the number of test cases. T lines follow. Each T contains an integer N whose square root needs to be computed.

Output

For each line of input output the square root of the input integer.

Constraints

1<=T<=20 
1<=N<=10000 

Input:
3
10
5
10000

Output:
3
2
100
