  After visiting a childhood friend, Chef wants to get back to his home. Friend lives at the first street, and Chef himself lives at the N-th (and the last) street. Their city is a bit special: you can move from the X-th street to the Y-th street if and only if 1 <= Y - X <= K, where K is the integer value that is given to you. Chef wants to get to home in such a way that the product of all the visited streets' special numbers is minimal (including the first and the N-th street). Please, help him to find such a product. 
Input
The first line of input consists of two integer numbers - N and K - the number of streets and the value of K respectively. The second line consist of N numbers  - A1, A2, ..., AN respectively, where Ai equals to the special number of the i-th street.
Output
Please output the value of the minimal possible product, modulo 1000000007.
