 
Let's consider a triangle of numbers in which a number appears in the first line, two numbers appear in the second line, three in the third line, etc. Develop a program which will compute the largest of the sums of numbers that appear on the paths starting from the top towards the base, so that:
 on each path the next number is located on the row below, more precisely either directly below or below and one place to the right;
 the number of rows is strictly positive, but less than 100 
 all numbers are positive integers between O and 99.


Input

In the first line integer n - the number of test cases (equal to about 1000). 
Then n test cases follow. Each test case starts with the number of lines which is followed by their content.
Output

For each test case write the determined value in a separate line. 

Example


Input:
2
3
1
2 1
1 2 3
4 
1 
1 2 
4 1 2
2 3 1 1 

Output:
5
9
