  Once N boys and M girls attended a party. You are given a matrix A of N rows and M columns where Aij is 1 if the i-th boy likes the j-th girl, otherwise it will be 0. Note that it is not necessary that if a boy x likes girl y, then girl y should like boy x.
You know that if there are two different boys x and y, who both like girl z, then there will be a collision.
Can you calculate the number of different collisions at this party? Note that order of boys in the collision doesn't matter.
Input
The first line contains a single integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow.
The first line of each test case contains two space separated integers N, M denoting the number of boys and girls, respectively.
Each of the following N lines contain M characters, each of them is either '0' or '1'.
Output
For each test case output a single line containing an integer corresponding to the number of collisions at the party.
Constraints

Explanation
Example Case 1. All three boys like the first girl, so there are (1, 2, 1), (1, 3, 1), (2, 3, 1) collisions with her. Boys 1 and 3 both like the second girl so this is one more collision. Only one boy likes the third girl, so there are no collisions with her and thus we have 4 collisions total.
Example Case 2. For each girl there is only one boy who likes her, so there are no collisions at all.
