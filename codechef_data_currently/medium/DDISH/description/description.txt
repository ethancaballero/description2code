 
Chef is the owner of the loveliest restaurant in ChefTown. To make his work easier, all dishes are numbered by distinct positive integers, and you can order with this positive integer in Chef\u2019s restaurant. Amazingly Chef has many kinds of recipes, so every positive integer denotes exactly one dish. To taste dish numbered with some integer C, you have to pay exactly C dollars.


Unfortunately not all the dishes are delicious. After years of working in his restaurant, Chef discovered that a dish is considered to be delicious if the number that denotes this dish consists of different digits. Let\u2019s call such numbers \u201cdelicious numbers\u201d. For example numbers 123, 1, 91, 102 are delicious but 122, 11, 900 are not.
