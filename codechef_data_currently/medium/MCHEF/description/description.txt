  Chef loves to prepare delicious dishes. He has prepared N dishes numbered from 1 to N for this year's MasterChef contest. He has presented all the N dishes to a panel of judges. Judging panel consists of M judges numbered from 1 to M. Rating for each dish was decided by voting from all the judges. Rating for the dishes has been given by a 1-indexed array A where Ai denotes rating of the ith dish.
Some dishes prepared by chef are extraordinary delicious, but unfortunately, some are not. Chef has been given a chance to improve the total rating of his dishes. By total rating of dishes, we mean the sum of the ratings of his dishes. Each of the M judges has administrative power to remove some (zero or more) dishes from a specified range. The ith judge takes Ci rupees for removing each dish of Chef's choice from the dishes numbered from Li to Ri (both inclusive). Once a dish is removed by any of the M judges it will not be considered for calculating total rating of the dishes. Chef has spent a large portion of his money preparing mouth watering dishes and has only K rupees left for now. Now chef is worried about maximizing total rating of his dishes by dropping some of the N dishes.
Please Help chef by finding the maximum total rating he can achieve such that the total expenditure does not exceed his budget of K rupees.
