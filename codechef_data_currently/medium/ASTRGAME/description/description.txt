 Teddy and Tracy like to play a game based on strings. The game is as follows. Initially, Tracy writes a long random string on a whiteboard. Then, each player starting with Teddy makes turn alternately. Each turn, the player must erase a contiguous substring that exists in the dictionary. The dictionary consists of N words.

Of course, the player that can't erase any substring in his turn loses the game, and the other player is declared the winner.

Note that after a substring R is erased, the remaining substring becomes separated, i.e. they cannot erase a word that occurs partially to the left of R and partially to the right of R.

Determine the winner of the game, assuming that both players play optimally.

Input
The first line contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The first line of each testcase contains a string S, the string Tracy writes on the whiteboard. The next line contains a single integer N. N lines follow. The i-th line contains a single string wi, the i-th word in the dictionary.

Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the name of the winner of the game.

Example

Input:
