  Chef loves lucky numbers. Everybody knows that lucky numbers are positive integers whose decimal representation contains only the lucky digits 4 and 7. For example, numbers 47, 744, 4 are lucky and 5, 17, 467 are not.

 Let Fd(x) equals to the number of digits d in decimal representation of the positive integer x. Chef interests only in functions F4(x) and F7(x). For the given positive integer N he wants to know the total number of different pairs (L; R) such that  F4(L) + F4(L + 1) + ... + F4(R) equals to  F7(L) + F7(L + 1) + ... + F7(R) and 1 \u2264  L \u2264 R \u2264 N.

Input
 The first line contains a single positive integer T, the number of test cases. T test cases follow. The only line of each test case contains a positive integer N .

Output
 For each test case, output a single line containing the answer for the corresponding test case.
