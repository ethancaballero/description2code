  Given an integer N, Chef wants to find the smallest positive integer M such that the bitwise XOR of M and M+1 is N. If no such M exists output -1.
Input
The first line of input contain an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains an integer N for that test case.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the number M or -1 as described above.
Constraints

1 \u2264 T \u2264 5000
1 \u2264 N \u2264 230

Example
Input:
1
3

Output:
1
Explanation
First Example :  M desired in the problem would be 1. As bitwise XOR of 1 and 2 is equal to 3.
