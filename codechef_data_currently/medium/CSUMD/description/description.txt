        Your task is to find out the the number of ways to create a linear arrangement of these coins so that their sum is N cents. The only condition on the linear arrangement is that
        the first coin in the arrangement should always face heads. All other coins could either face head or face tail.
        
    
    
        Take N = 2 as an example. The possible arrangements are (1H, 1H), (2H), (1H, 1T), where H is heads and T is tails.
        Therefore there are 3 possible arrangements that sum up to 2-cents.
    
    
        Note
    
    
        While counting make sure that you count heads and tails as different.
    
    
        Input
    
    
        First line contains T, the number of cases.
    
    
        T lines follow, each containing a single number N, the required sum.
    
    
        Constraints
    
    
        0 <= T <= 10000
    
    
        1 <= N <= 1000000000
    
    
        Output
    
    
For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of such arrangements possible. As this can be very large print it modulo        1000000007.
