 A Little Elephant from the Zoo of Lviv likes lucky strings, i.e., the strings that consist only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.

The Little Elephant calls some string T of the length M balanced if there exists at least one integer X (1 \u2264 X \u2264 M) such that the number of digits 4 in the substring T[1, X - 1] is equal to the number of digits 7 in the substring T[X, M]. For example, the string S = 7477447 is balanced since S[1, 4] = 7477 has 1 digit 4 and S[5, 7] = 447 has 1 digit 7. On the other hand, one can verify that the string S = 7 is not balanced.

 The Little Elephant has the string S of the length N. He wants to know the number of such pairs of integers (L; R) that 1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 N and the substring S[L, R]  is balanced. Help him to find this number.

Notes.

Let S be some lucky string. Then



|S| denotes the length of the string S;

S[i] (1 \u2264 i \u2264 |S|) denotes the ith character of S (the numeration of characters starts from 1);

 S[L, R] (1 \u2264 L \u2264 R \u2264 |S|) denotes the string with the following sequence of characters: S[L], S[L + 1], ..., S[R], and is called a substring of S. For L > R we mean by S[L, R] an empty string.



Input
The first line of the input file contains a single integer T, the number of test cases. Each of the following T lines contains one string, the string S for the corresponding test case. The input file does not contain any whitespaces.

Output
For each test case output a single line containing the answer for this test case.

Constraints
 1 \u2264 T \u2264 10
 1 \u2264 |S| \u2264 100000
 S consists only of the lucky digits 4 and 7.


Example


Input:
4

477

Output:
2
2
3
23



Explanation
In the first test case balance substrings are S[1, 1] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 47.
In the second test case balance substrings are S[2, 2] = 4 and S[1, 2] = 74.
Unfortunately, we can't provide you with the explanations of the third and the fourth test cases. You should figure it out by yourself. Please, don't ask about this in comments.
