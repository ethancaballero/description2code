 Yesterday Chef had a great party and doesn't remember the way he celebreated it. But he found a strange paper in his kitchen containing n digits (lets give them indices from 1 to n and name them a1, a2 ... aN). 
 Chef remembers that he played such game:

 On each step he choose an index x from 1 to n.
 For all indices y (y < x) he calculated the difference by = ax - ay. 
 Then he calculated B1 - sum of all by which are greater than 0 and B2 - sum of all by which are less than 0. 
 The answer for this step is B1 - B2. 

Chef remembers the game, but forgot the answer. Please, help him!
Input

The first line contains two integers n, m denoting the number of digits and number of steps. The second line contains n digits (without spaces) a1, a2, ..., an. 
 Each of next m lines contains single integer x denoting the index for current step.

Output

For each of m steps print single number in a line - answer of the step.

Explanation
For index 1 there are no indexes which are less, so B1 = B2 = 0 and the answer is 0.
For index 4 we have 

b1 = 4-0=4, 
b2 = 4-3=1, 
b3 = 4-2=2, 

so B1 = 4+1+2 = 7, B2 = 0 
and the answer is 7.
For index 7 we have

b1 = 2-0=2, 
b2 = 2-3=-1, 
b3 = 2-2=0, 
b4 = 2-4=-2, 
b5 = 2-1=1, 
b6 = 2-5=-3, 

so B1 = 2 + 1 = 3,
     B2 = -1 -2 -3 = -6 
and the answer is 9.
