  Chef has a square matrix A. He would like to choose a consecutive sub-matrix of A such that value of bitwise XOR of all elements in it is maximal.
Each sub-matrix can be defined by four numbers (x1,y1,x2,y2), with the meaning that the submatrix contains an element A[i][j] iff x1 \u2264 i \u2264 x2 and y1 \u2264 j \u2264 y2.

Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows.
The first line of each test case contains a single integer N denoting the size of the matrix A.
The following N lines contain N space-separated integers, denoting values of elements in given matrix. The j-th element in the i-th line denotes the value of A[i][j].
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing the maximal bitwise XOR a submatrix of A
Constraints

1 \u2264 T \u2264 10
1 \u2264 N \u2264 70
1 \u2264 Ai,j \u2264 109
Subtask 1 (40 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 20
Subtask 2 (60 points): 1 \u2264 N \u2264 70


Example
Input:
1
3
1 4 3
1 8 6
1 2 3

Output:
15
Explanation
Chef can pick the following submatrix in order to make the XOR of elements equal to 15:

1 4 3
1 8 6
1 2 3

This submatrix can be defined by x1 = 1, y1 = 1, x2 = 3, y2 = 2.
