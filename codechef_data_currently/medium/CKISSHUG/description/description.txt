 
    
        Princess Artapoelc greeted her guests by either kissing on the cheek (K) or hugging (H). From the first guest 

she kisses, she has a
compulsion to necessarily kiss every alternate guest from that first kissed guest. That is if the guests are G1, 

G2, ..., Gi, Gi+1, ..., Gn and if she first kissed Gi then she must necessarily kiss 

Gi+2, Gi+4, Gi+6 ... till the last
        possible guest. Your task is to determine in how many ways she can greet N guests.
    
    
        Input
    
    First line of the input contains T (T \u2264 1000) denoting the number of test cases.
    
        T
        lines follow each containing a single integer N (1 \u2264 N \u2264 10^9) denoting the number of guests.
    
    
        
    
    
        Output
    
    
        For each case the output should be a single integer representing the number of ways Artapoelc can greet N guests. As the 

answer can be large
        print it modulo 1000000007.
