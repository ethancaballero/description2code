 Let A be a set of the first N positive integers :A={1,2,3,4.........N}

Let B be the set containing all the subsets of A.

Professor Eric is a mathematician who defined two kind of relations R1 and R2 on set B. 

The relations are defined as follows:

R1={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is equal to empty set }

R2={ (x,y) : x and y belong to B and x is not a subset of y and y is not a subset of x and the intersection of x and y is not equal to empty set }

Now  given the number N,Professor Eric wants to know how many relations of kind R1 and R2 exists.Help him. 

 NOTE : (x,y) is the same as (y,x) ,i.e the pairs are unordered.
Input format:
The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the test case is denoted by a single integer N.
Output format:
Output T lines, one for each test case,containing  two integers denoting the number of relations of kind R1 and R2 respectively, modulo 100000007.
Example

Sample Input:
3
1
2
3
Sample Output:
0 0
1 0
6 3
Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000
1 <= N <= 10^18
Explanation:
Let A={1,2}
Then B={Phi,{1},{2},{1,2}}
Phi=Empty Set
So R1=Either {({1},{2})} or {({2},{1})}
and R2=No relation exists
So,there is 1 relation of kind R1 and 0 relation of kind R2.
