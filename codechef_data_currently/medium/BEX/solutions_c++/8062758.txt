/*
 * Book Exercises (BEX)
 *
 * Use a stack to store only the books which might be required.
 * On empty stack, the first book is always pushed.
 * Second onwards, we compare number of exercise. If it is lower/equal
 * than top, than it is pushed (not to be confused with stored).
 * Note that, books with 0 exercises are not to be considered.
 * If exercises are greater than the one on top, we just update the top
 * to tell the number of books above it.
