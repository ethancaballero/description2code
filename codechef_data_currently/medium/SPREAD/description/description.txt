 Bob has n heap(s) of gravel (initially there are exactly c piece(s) in each). He wants to do m operation(s) with that heaps, each maybe:

adding pieces of gravel onto the heaps from u to v, exactly k pieces for each,
or querying "how many pieces of gravel are there in the heap p now?".



Request
Help Bob do operations of the second type.

Input


The first line contains the integers n,m,c, respectively.
m following lines, each forms:

S u v k to describe an operation of the first type.
Q p to describe an operation of the second type.


(Each integer on a same line, or between the characters S, Q and the integers is separated by at least one space character)



Output
For each operation of the second type, output (on a single line) an integer answering to the respective query (follows the respective Input order).

Example

Input:

7 5 0
Q 7
S 1 7 1
Q 3
S 1 3 1
Q 3


Output:

0
1
2
