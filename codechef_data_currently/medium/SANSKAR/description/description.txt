  Alok-nath is man of equality. He needs your help to divide his \u201csanskars\u201d evenly amongst all his followers. By doing this, Alok-nath can create equality amongst his followers and he'll be called a true \u201csanskari\u201d.
Alok-nath has N sanskars, and K followers. Each sanskar is given a numerical value which shows its intensity.
Your task is to determine whether it is possible to allocate all the sanskars to followers in such a way that the sum of intensities of the sanskars allocated to each follower is equal. Note : A sanskar can be allocated to only one of the followers.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T, denoting the number of test cases. Then T test cases follow. The first line of each case contains two integers N and K, with N denoting the number of sanskars and K denoting the number of followers. In the next line are N space separated integers denoting the intensities of each sanskar.
Output
For each test case, output "yes" if it is possible to divide his sanskars equally amongst his followers; otherwise output "no" (without quotes).
Constraints

1 \u2264 T \u2264 10
1 \u2264 N \u2264 21
1 \u2264 K \u2264 8
Subtask #1 (20 points) : 0 \u2264 intensity of sanskar \u2264 10^5
Subtask #2 (80 points) : 0 \u2264 intensity of sanskar \u2264 10^10


Example
Input:
2
5 3
1 2 4 5 6
5 3
1 2 4 5 7

Output:
yes
no

Explanation
In the first case, sanskars can be allocated as follows, each follower receiving a total intensity of 6: {1,5}, {2,4}, {6}.
