  
Given a sequence of n distinct numbers a[1..n], we want to sort them in an ascending order.


An interesting property of some sequences is that all numbers are almost at their correct position! More formally, the distance between the current position of any value is at most 1 from its correct position in a sorted order.


Now, you want to verify whether the input sequence has such a property.


Note that the time limit for this problem is 0.2 seconds. Please try to write a very efficient algorithm and implementation.

Input
The first line contains an integer T denoting the total number of test cases.
For each test case, the first line contains a single integer n, and the second line contains a[1..n] as a single space-separated list.
Output
For each test case, output "YES" or "NO" (without quotes) to indicate whether the input sequence has such a property.
Constraints

1 <= T <= 10
1 <= n <= 10^6
1 <= a[i] <= 10^9

Example
Input:
2
3
1 2 3
5
2 4 1 3 5
Output:
YES
NO
