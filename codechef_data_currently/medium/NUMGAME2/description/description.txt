 Alice and Bob play the following game.They choose a number N to play with.The runs are as follows :

1.Bob plays first and the two players alternate.

2.In his\/her turn ,a player can subtract from N any prime     number(including 1) less than N.The number thus obtained is the new N.

3.The person who cannot make a move in his\/her turn loses the game.

Assuming both play optimally,who wins the game ?
Input format:
The first line contains the number of test cases T.Each of the next lines contains an integer N.
Output format:
Output T lines one for each test case,containing "ALICE" if Alice wins the game ,or "BOB" if Bob wins the game.
Example

Sample Input:
2
1
2

Sample Output:
ALICE
BOB

Constraints:
1 <= T <= 1000000
1 <= N <= 1000000000


Note : For the first test case, Bob cannot make any move and hence Alice wins the game. For the second test case, Bob subtracts 1 from N. Now, Alice cannot make a move and loses the game.
