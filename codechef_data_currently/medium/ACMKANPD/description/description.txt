 As we know, in an n-based number system, there are n different types of digits. In this way, a 1-based number system has only 1 type of digit, the ‘0’. Here are the rules to interpret 1-based numbers. Each number consists of some space separated blocks of 0. A block may have 1, 2 or more 0s. There is a ‘flag’ variable associated with each number 
    
    
        A block with a single 0 sets ‘flag’ variable to 1 
        A block with two 0s sets the ‘flag’ to 0 
        If there are n (n > 2) 0s in a block, "cmmi-10x-x-109">n-2 binary digits with the current value of flag is appended to your number.
    
        



Note that, the first block of every number will have at most 2 0s. For example, the 1-base number 0 0000 00 000 0 0000 is equivalent to binary 11011. 
    
        1st block sets the flag to 1. 
        2nd block has 4 0s. So append flag(= 1) 42 = 2 times (11).
        3rd block has 2 0s. Set the flag to 0. 
        4th block has 3 0s. Append flag(= 0) 3 "cmsy-10x-x-109">− 2 = 1 time (110). 
        5th block has a single 0. Set flag = 1. 
        6th and block has 4 0s. Append flag(= 0) 4 "cmsy-10x-x-109">− 2 = 2 times (11011). 
    

            
        The final binary number wont have more than 30 digits. Once, youve completed the process, convert the binary value to decimal & print, youre done! 
            
            
Input 
           Input will have at most 100 test cases. Each case consists of a 1-based number as described above. A number may be spanned to multiple lines but a single block will always be in a single line. Termination of a case will be indicated by a single ‘#’ char which will be space-separated from the last digit of your input number. The last case in the input is followed by a ‘ "cmsy-10x-x-109">∼’ character indicating, end of input. 
               
Output 
    For each test case, output a single line with the decimal equivalent value of your given 1-based number.
