 
Did you know that the Hindus believe there are 330 million deities ? Lets discuss about them in long contests. The three main forces of god Brahma, Vishnu and Mahesh, also called Trimurti ( 3 forms ), want to decide when to end the world. Given an array A, which contains the 'Good' ( or 'Evil' ) score of each place on earth, they can easily find the maximum sum of the scores of a (contiguous) sub-array of places. But this is not much useful to them. So, each of them gives a value K and want to know the Kth maximum sum of scores of a contiguous sub-array. In other words, find the value of S[K] (1-based index), where the array S contains the sums of all possible contiguous sub-arrays in non-increasing order.

Input

First line contains T, number of test cases. T cases follow. In each test case, first line contains N K1 K2 K3. Next line contains N space separated integers.



Output

For each test case, output the K1th, K2th and K3th maximum sum in a single line, separated by a single space. See sample cases and explanation for more clarity.

Constraints

1 \u2264 T \u2264 3
2 \u2264 N \u2264 10000
1 \u2264 K1 < K2 < K3 \u2264 2012
K3 \u2264 N*(N+1)\/2
-10000 \u2264 A[i] \u2264 10000


Example


Input:
3
3 1 2 3
10 20 30
3 3 4 6
10 20 30
4 2 6 10
20 -15 10 -15

Output:
60 50 30
30 30 10
15 -5 -20


Explanation:
Case 1 & 2 : A = { 10, 20, 30 }. All possible sums of sub-arrays in non-increasing order, S[1..6] = { 60, 50, 30, 30, 20, 10 }

Warning : "Large input \/ output. Be careful with certain languages. Eg: Prefer using scanf\/printf to cin\/cout for C++"

Note : There are multiple test sets, and the judge shows the sum of the time taken over all test sets of your submission, if Accepted.
