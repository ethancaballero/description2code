 Chef feels that being the Head Chef is a very difficult job. More than cooking, managing the kitchen and distributing the work between various cooks proves to be a tiring task. There are many dishes to be prepared. And he has a team of talented cooks to do this for him. But the Chef always has a problem distributing tasks among them. For a cook i, the Chef wants to give him atleast xi dishes to prepare in a day. But different cooks have different capacities. Any cook i can cook atmost yi number of dishes in a single day. Chef is very aware of every cook's capability and will not give anyone more work than his maximum capacity. Now, he wants you to help him out here.

Constraints:
1<=T<=50
1<=n,m<=100
0<=xi,yi<=100
