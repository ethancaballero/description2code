  Chef's love for Fibonacci numbers helps him to design following interesting problem.
He defines a function F for an array S as follows:


where

Si denotes a non-empty subset of multiset S.
sum(Si) denotes the sum of all element of multiset Si.
Fibonacci(x) denotes the xth Fibonacci number.


Given an array A consisting of N elements. Chef asked you to process following two types of queries on this array accurately and efficiently.

C X Y: Change the value of Xth element of array to Y i.e AX = Y.
Q L R: Compute function F over the subarray defined by the elements of array A in the range L to R, both inclusive.



Please see the Note section if you need details regarding Fibonacci function.

Input
First line of input contains 2 space separated integer N and M denoting the size of array A and the number of queries to be performed. Next line of input contains N space separated integers denoting the elements of array A. Each of next M lines of input contains a query having one of the mentioned two types.
Output
For each query of type Q, output the value of function F for the given range of array A.
Constraints

1 \u2264 N, M \u2264 105
1 \u2264 Ai, Y \u2264 109
1 \u2264 L, R, X \u2264 N
 type = {'C', 'Q'} 

Example
Input

3 5
1 2 3
Q 1 2
Q 2 3
C 1 2
Q 1 2
Q 1 3

Output

4
8
5
30
Explanation:

Q1 : F = Fibonacci(1) + Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(1+2) = 4 % 1000000007 = 4
Q2 : F = Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(3) + Fibonacci(2+3) = 8 % 1000000007 = 8
Q3 : A = {2, 2, 3}
Q4 : F = Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(2+2) = 5 % 1000000007 = 5
Q5 : F = Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(2) + Fibonacci(3) + Fibonacci(2+2) + Fibonacci(2+3) + Fibonacci(2+3) + Fibonacci(2+2+3) = 30 % 1000000007 = 30

Note
FibonacciK denotes the Kth Fibonacci number. Fibonacci series is defined as follows:

For 1 \u2264 K \u2264 2, FibonacciK = 1
Otherwise, FibonacciK = FibonacciK-1 + FibonacciK-2
