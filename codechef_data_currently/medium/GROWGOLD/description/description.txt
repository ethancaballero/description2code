 
Long ago there was a beautiful kingdom in the island of Sona, the golden island, deep inside Africa. 
The trees in Sona island are made of gold and farmers are the richest group of people and are also heavy tax payers.


As you know that price of gold increases every year, the minister of Sona has proposed the following tax policy.

Pay initTax units of gold in the first year.
In each of the next slot1 years, pay one unit of gold more than the previous year.
In each of the next slot2 years, pay double the units of gold of the previous year.
In each of the following years, pay number of gold units equal to the product of the number of units paid in K recent years.



Given an integer N, find the number of units of gold to be paid in the Nth year. This result can be huge, so output the result modulo 100000007 (108+7).


Input
First line has an integer T (number of test cases, 1 \u2264 T \u2264 3). Each of the next T lines has 5 integers, initTax slot1 slot2 K N.
1 \u2264 initTax, slot1, slot2 \u2264 50
1 \u2264 K \u2264 slot1 + slot2 + 1
1 \u2264 N \u2264 1000000000 (109)

Output
For each test case, output the tax in units of gold to be paid in the Nth year modulo 100000007  (108+7).

Example


Input:
3
1 3 2 4 4
1 3 2 4 7
1 3 2 4 9

Output:
4
1536
18811834


Explanation:
Let tax[i] be the tax paid in ith year.
Init : tax[1] = 1
Next 3 years in slot1 (tax[i] = tax[i-1] + 1) : tax[2] = 2 , tax[3] = 3, tax[4] = 4
Next 2 years in slot2 (tax[i] = 2 * tax[i-1]) : tax[5] = 8 , tax[6] = 16
We have tax[1..6] = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 16 }
tax[7] = tax[3] * tax[4] * tax[5] * tax[6] = 3 * 4 * 8 * 16 = 1536
similarly, tax[9] = tax[5] * tax[6] * tax[7] * tax[8].
Do not forget to print only the reminder of the result when divided by 100000007 (108+7).
