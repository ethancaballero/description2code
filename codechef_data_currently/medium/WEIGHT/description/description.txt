 Statement

Let us denote an n digit decimal number by a1a2a3...an with the condition that each ai should be between 0 and 9 inclusive except a1 which should be between 1 and 9 inclusive. The weight of such a number is defined as the sum of absolute difference between adjacent numbers. Precisely the weight can be defined as,


	weight = 0
	For i = 1 to n-1
  		weight = weight + ABS(ai+1 - ai)



Here ABS is the absolute value of the argument.
Given n and a weight w, find all the n digit numbers having a weight w. Since the answer could be very large, print the answer modulo 1000007.

Input Format:
The first line contains one integer t, the number of testcases. (1 <= t <= 150) 
This will be followed by t lines each consisting of numbers n and w.

Constraints:

2 <= n <= 20
0 <= w <= 200


Output Format:
For each test case print the answer modulo 1000007 in a separate line.

Sample Input:

2
10 0
2 1

Sample Output:

9
17
