 Chef had constructed 2 buildings - one of height N and another of height M.
He was unhappy, and wanted both buildings to be of the same height.
In one move, he could either add a floor to a building, or remove a floor from a building.
Help him find the minimum number of moves to make the heights equal.
Input
First line contains a positive integer T - the total number of testcases.
T lines follow, each representing a test case.
Each line contains 2 space-separated positive integers - N and M.
