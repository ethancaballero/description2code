 Given an integer N. Integers A and B are chosen randomly in the range [1..N]. Calculate the probability that the Greatest Common Divisor(GCD) of A and B equals to B.
Input
The first line of the input contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. The description of T test cases follows. Each test case consists of a single integer N on a separate line.
Output
For each test case, output a single line containing probability as an irreducible fraction.
