 
Let X be the set of all integers between 0 and n-1. Suppose we have a collection S1, S2, ..., Sm of subsets of X. Say an atom A is a subset of X such that for each Si we have either A is a subset of Si or A and Si do not have any common elements.


Your task is to find a collection A1, ..., Ak of atoms such that every item in X is in some Ai and no two Ai, Aj with i \u2260 j share a common item. Surely such a collection exists as we could create a single set {x} for each x in X. A more interesting question is to minimize k, the number of atoms.

Input

The first line contains a single positive integer t \u2264 30 indicating the number of test cases. Each test case begins with two integers n,m where n is the size of X and m is the number of sets Si. Then m lines follow where the i'th such line begins with an integer vi between 1 and n (inclusive) indicating the size of Si. Following this are vi distinct integers between 0 and n-1 that describe the contents of Si.


You are guaranteed that 1 \u2264 n \u2264 100 and 1 \u2264 m \u2264 
30. Furthermore, each number between 0 and n-1 will appear in at least one set Si.
Output

For each test case you are to output a single integer indicating the minimum number of atoms that X can be partitioned into to satisfy the constraints.
