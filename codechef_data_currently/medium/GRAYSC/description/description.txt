 
The Gray code (see wikipedia for more details) is a well-known concept.
One of its important properties is that every two adjacent numbers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation.


In this problem, we will give you n non-negative integers in a sequence A[1..n] (0<=A[i]<2^64), such that every two adjacent integers have exactly one different digit in their binary representation, similar to the Gray code.


Your task is to check whether there exist 4 numbers A[i1], A[i2], A[i3], A[i4] (1 <= i1 < i2 < i3 < i4 <= n) out of the given n numbers such that A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0. Here xor is a bitwise operation which is same as ^ in C, C++, Java and xor in Pascal.

Input
First line contains one integer n (4<=n<=100000).
Second line contains n space seperated non-negative integers denoting the sequence A.
Output
Output \u201cYes\u201d (quotes exclusive) if there exist four distinct indices i1, i2, i3, i4 such that A[i1] xor A[i2] xor A[i3] xor A[i4] = 0. Otherwise, output "No" (quotes exclusive) please.
