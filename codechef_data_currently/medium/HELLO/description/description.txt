 Chef talks a lot on his mobile phone. As a result he exhausts his talk-value (in Rokdas) very quickly. One day at a mobile recharge shop, he noticed that his service provider gives add-on plans which can lower his calling rates (Rokdas\/minute). One of the plans said "Recharge for 28 Rokdas and enjoy call rates of 0.50 Rokdas\/min for one month". Chef was very pleased. His normal calling rate is 1 Rokda\/min. And he talked for 200 minutes in last month, which costed him 200 Rokdas. If he had this plan activated, it would have costed him: 28 + 0.5*200 = 128 Rokdas only! Chef could have saved 72 Rokdas. But if he pays for this add-on and talks for very little in the coming month, he may end up saving nothing or even wasting money. Now, Chef is a simple guy and he doesn't worry much about future. He decides to choose the plan based upon his last month\u2019s usage.
There are numerous plans. Some for 1 month, some for 15 months. Some reduce call rate to 0.75 Rokdas\/min, some reduce it to 0.60 Rokdas\/min. And of course each of them differ in their activation costs. Note - If a plan is valid for M months, then we must pay for (re)activation after every M months (once in M months). Naturally, Chef is confused, and you (as always) are given the task to help him choose the best plan.
Input
First line contains T- the number of test cases. In each test case, first line contains D- the default rate (Rokdas\/minute, real number), U- the number of minutes Chef talked in last month and N- the number of add-on plans available. Then N lines follow, each containing M- the number of months the plan is valid for, R- the calling rate for the plan (Rokdas\/minute, real number) and C- the cost of the plan.
Output
For each test case, output one integer- the number of the best plan (from 1 to N). Output '0' if no plan is advantageous for Chef. No two plans are equally advantageous.

Explanation
Test Case 1: This test case is same as the example in the problem statement.Test Case 2: This is for you to work out!Test Case 3: Chef's monthly usage is only 50 Rokdas and none of the 2 plans are advantageous, hence the answer is zero '0'.Test Case 4: Again solve it yourself, but NOTE - if Chef had chosen plan 1, he would have to pay 10 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 3 months and NOT every month. Similarly had he chosen plan 2, he would have to pay 20 Rokdas (Activation cost), after every 2 months.
