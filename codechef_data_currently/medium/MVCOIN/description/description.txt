 There is a line with 1000 cells numbered from 1 to 1000 from left to right and N coins placed on it. Coin i is placed at cell Xi, and no two coins are placed at the same cell.

Bob would like to move the coins to the N leftmost cells of the line. To do this, he is allowed to take a coin from any cell T and move it to cell T-j, where j is an integer between 1 and K, inclusive. This action is possible only if:
 cell T-j actually exists and doesn't contain a coin;
 each of the cells T-j+1, ..., T-1 contains a coin.

One coin movement takes exactly one second. Find the smallest time in which Bob can achieve his goal.

Input
The first line of the input file contains one integer T -- the number of test cases (no more than 10). Then T test cases follow, and every test case is described by two lines: the first of them contains two integers N and K (1 <= N, K <= 1000), the second of them contains N integers X1, ..., XN in strictly increasing order (1 <= Xi <= 1000).

Output
For each test case output one line containing the requested minimal time for Bob to put all the coins to the left side of the line.

Example


Input:
2
3 2
2 4 7
5 3
1 2 3 4 5

Output:
5
0

Explanation:

In the first example Bob can move the coin from cell 7 consequently to cells 6, 5, 3 and 1, then move the coin from cell 4 to cell 3. In the second example there is nothing to move.
