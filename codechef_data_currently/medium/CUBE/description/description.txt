  This winter our chef plans to unveil his latest creation - Cube Cakes. As the name suggests, this new delicacy is a cake in the form of a perfect cube with secret ingredients from the chef's inventory. Since it is a relatively new creation of the chef, he wants to master the ability to make perfectly identical Cube Cakes. For this, he wants you to write a program that will calculate the similarity between two given Cube Cakes. 
 
 Each Cube Cake can be represented as a cube of size N where each cell of the cube contains a lowercase alphabet ('a'-'z').  The similarity between two Cube Cakes ( of size  N   each ) is defined as the maximum sized common sub-cube that exists at exactly the same position in both the Cube Cakes. Two sub-cubes are said to be common if at-least P% of their corresponding characters are equal. You need to find the size S of the largest such sub-cube and also the number of common sub-cubes of size S in the Cube Cake.
Input
 The first line contains an integer T denoting the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of testcases follows. 
 The first line of each testcase contains integers N (the size of the Cube Cakes A and B that are to be compared) and  P.
The next line contains a string SA containing  N3  lowercase characters ('a'-'z'), where the  A[i][j][k]th element of the Cube Cake A is given by SA[ i*N*N + j*N + k ] where 0 \u2264  i, j, k   \u2264  N-1 .
The next line contains a string SB containing  N3  lowercase characters ('a'-'z'), SB is the description of the Cube Cake B in the way analogical to A.

Output
 For every test case, print in a single line the similarity between the two Cube Cakes  S  and the number of common sub-cubes of size S.
If there is no common sub cube present, just print -1 in a single line.
Constraints

 1  \u2264 T \u2264  40
 1  \u2264 N \u2264  40
 0  \u2264 P \u2264  100
 | SA |, |SB |   =  N3

Example
Input:
3
2 40
abcdefgh
abcdefgh
2 100
abcdefgh
ccccccch
1 100
a
b

Output:
2 1
1 2
-1
Explanation
Example case 1.
Since both the Cube Cakes are identical, the whole cube matches and hence the similarity is 2. Also, there is only one sub-cube of size 2.
 
Example case 2.
Since P is 100, all characters in the sub-cube must match. The sub cube 'c' and 'h' each of size 1 are the largest cube satisfying this criteria. Hence the similarity is  1  and corresponding count is 2 .
Example case 3.
Since no  characters match in the cube, we cannot find a common subcube here.
