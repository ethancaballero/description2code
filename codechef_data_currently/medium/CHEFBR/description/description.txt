 Chef loves brackets. So much so, that rather than just use plain brackets like (), {}, or [], he has invented his own notation that allows him to use many more types of brackets.
Each type of bracket is designated by an integer. A negative integer -x represents an opening bracket of type x; while a positive integer x represents a closing bracket of type x. Any sequence of such integers is then called a bracket-pair sequence.
A balanced bracket-pair sequence can be defined recursively as follows:

The empty sequence is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.
If S is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, then -x S x is a balanced bracket-pair sequence for any positive integer x. 
If S and T are balanced bracket-pair sequences, then S T is a balanced bracket-pair sequence.

For example, "-1 -2 2 -3 -4 4 3 1" is a balanced bracket-pair sequence, but "-1 -2 1 2" is not.
Chef has a bracket-pair sequence (which may or may not be balanced) consisting of N integers. There are 2N ways to form a subsequence of his sequence. He wants to know how many of these subsequences are balanced.
Help him to calculate this number, modulo 109+7.
Input
The first line contains a single integer N denoting the number of brackets in his sequence.
The second line contains N space-separated integers A1, A2, ..., AN denoting the types of brackets. A negative number means an opening bracket; a positive number means a closing bracket.
Output
In a single line print the required answer.

It is not guaranteed that each opening bracket has a closing bracket of same type and vice-versa.
